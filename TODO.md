# TODO

* Specs
* Update feed URI on permanent redirect
* Do not mark entry as sent if email was not sent
* Show entry metadata in email (e.g. pubdate, author)
* Detect entry URI changes (maybe by comparing body hashes?)
* Profiles (support many feed lists and recipients)
* Filters (e.g. skip entries matching a pattern)
* Plugin architecture
